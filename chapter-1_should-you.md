# Should you become an engineering manager?

It wasn't a conscious decision when I became an engineering manager ages ago. I was a tech lead in a growing project, so we started hiring frantically, and I got in charge of new responsibilities like interviewing, onboarding, and then managing. Those responsibilities made me stop coding as a primary function. Then my boss said, “I guess you are the engineering manager now.”

At that time, I was happy because transitioning from senior engineer to engineering manager was the only career progression path for most companies. 

Fortunately, the tech industry moved on from this idea. The Staff Engineer role is now a possibility even in smaller companies. So there comes a time in the ambitious senior engineer’s career when they ask themselves:

> Should I become a staff engineer or an engineer manager?

People mostly decide on the former. Staying technical and avoiding bureaucracy at all costs are the main reasons the best engineers call themselves “hackers.” I had trouble promoting people to manager internally due to a lack of interest in the role, while no senior ever refused a promotion to become staff.

Most engineers prefer going into staff because they think it is a role where they can stay technical, avoid meetings, and continue coding. They believe being promoted to the manager role would require someone to give every piece of expertise acquired so far and forget being technical entirely.

However, being an engineering manager is not as dull as it seems. Most of your technical skills won't go to waste. Being a manager allows you to use your learning to develop new skills.


### **But why do we need managers, anyway?**

Some argue that some teams do not need a manager at all. While that may be true briefly, if you assemble a team of staff-level engineers for a small project, it becomes chaotic once you get more traction in the product and more people in the company are involved. 

Even in some companies like Valve, which claim to have no managers, people act in lead roles—they are just not permanent.

Having a manager means one person attending meetings representing the technical team instead of six, one person removing uncertainty with product stakeholders by pushing back crazy demands, someone looking at tech debt going too large, and in charge of hiring great team members to scale the team.


## **The good**

The best thing about being the engineering manager is that you are a force multiplier for the team. A good manager balances themself between areas, trying to fill out the team's gaps so every engineer can focus on what they know best, 

The flexibility of the role means that you can rarely bore yourself. One week, you can tackle tech debt; the other, you can be in charge of hiring. On the other week, if everything is calm, you can help by improving CI/CD so the engineers can ship with better assurance.

Ideally, you should not work too long in just one area if you want to succeed. Work produced that requires attention needs to be handed off as you scale your product. For example, I sometimes wear the PM hat if my PM is too busy, but if they are busy 100% of the time, it is time to look into hiring. This can also happen when the EM does DevOps or QA.


### Product Impact

You will significantly impact the product's outcome. Many times during my professional career, we, the engineer's squad, felt that the product we were building would not have any impact, and we were correct most of the time. Other times, we followed a process we knew was a huge time waster for us and the company. 

But in a project where the manager backed us up, we felt that our voice was amplified and louder than the sum of its parts. We shipped great work, had a growing and healthy squad, and going to work was something we happily did.

As a manager, you will have a broader impact on every area of software development and shape the final product outcome. Your primary responsibility will be ensuring a successful delivery.

Many times in my career, we successfully pushed for pivoting the feature into something else that brought more than a million in annual revenue and avoided doing something additional that would take months and wouldn't be worth it.


### People Impact

A good manager can make a bad company tolerable, and rarely do people decide to start a long, tedious interview process if they feel they are protected during storms. There is a saying that people don’t leave their jobs; they leave their managers. 

The well-being of eight hours of the engineer's day will be mostly on you. You are the difference between an anxious Sunday and a happy Monday.

If you like talking with engineers like me, managing is also a great way to get to know people and acquire people skills deeply. I always enjoy doing 1:1s and being able to help them as a manager, but when everything is okay, I also like to hear from them as people.

Software engineers are people with interesting hobbies and stories. You don't need to be or want to become a social butterfly if you don't want to, but getting to know their wants and hobbies will make you more of a people person. This is especially good in a WFH environment where you don't get to talk with people often.


### Path to entrepreneurship

If you are interested in starting your own company, managing inside another company is a way to acquire valuable business skills without taking on the risk. The other way around is accurate — starting a company requires an excellent management background.


## **The bad**

Mistakes in your team might not be your fault, but they will **always **be your responsibility.

If your engineer says he can ship something in 2 weeks, but it takes 2 months, it will be your responsibility to be accountable for that deadline. Another example would be if something goes wrong, like the production going offline, it will also be your responsibility to prevent it from happening again. Anything that goes wrong makes you the person accountable for preventing future errors.

That is why the engineering manager needs to be technical. Companies without technical EMs always become a mess because you cannot make hiring, estimation, engineer performance, project trade-offs, and architecture decisions if you don't know how software is done.


### Meetings

There will be many meetings, but you get used to them. Meetings are dreadful for engineers because they must unwind and re-enter the focus zone. However, as a manager, the meetings are the work we attend so the engineers can avoid them.

You will also have a say in attending meetings and can choose not to when you think you are not critical. You also have the power (and the responsibility) to make your team meetings more effective.


### Should the manager still code?

You will still code, but not as much as you would like. Some days, you will want to go there to do the work yourself. Sometimes, you will also know it would be faster if you did it. Giving to that urge is the most common mistake of newer managers. Your role is not an engineering addition but a force multiplier.

Your deliveries should be outside the sprint delivery because problems may require you to deprioritize your other tasks to resolve them. Since multiple engineers will be coding, this can be the first thing you can drop, but if you drop sprint work, you will block someone. 


## The Ugly

Up to senior engineer, getting promoted only depended on your skills. However, for the manager and staff role, the group needs to grow, or someone must quit. That is why moving into a growing company is necessary if you want to be a manager faster.

A typical team has 5 engineers and 1 manager, reflecting the number of open positions. So there are 5x more open senior engineer roles than manager roles.

Also, you cannot hop between companies as much as a software engineer because companies will not even interview you if you job-hop a lot. Therefore, accepting an offer comes with a giant risk.

Even if you are invited to interviews, they also suck. Since the roles change between companies, you will be interviewed by people who think their management style is the only way. So, if you come from a different background, they will flag you as someone who doesn't fit. As explained in the following chapters, there are ways to avoid that.


### The other side of the coin

If being interviewed is bad, interviewing people is worse. This critical process cannot be reliably scaled. Generally, the manager interviews first to protect the team’s attention. On average, you interview about 15-20 people before hiring a candidate. 

In some interviews, you know the candidate won’t pass in the first 15 minutes due to obvious issues (like cheating), and you will know that the next 30 minutes will be wasted. 


### Being accountable for decisions you didn’t make

The larger the company, the less power you have to change top-down decisions. If your boss’s boss’s boss enforces a bad policy, you will be heavily impacted and powerless to change it.

Even if a bad decision is not your responsibility, the team will hold you accountable for fighting against it. Sometimes, you cannot overcome the decisions, but you can find clever ways to work around them to make both parties happy. 

The worst thing is firing people. I have made the call several times in my career, and it never gets easy. Even in cases where people have given up on the job and are not to be trusted, firing is never easy—you are giving someone a hard time to give your other engineers an easier one. Most people are fired because they are a net negative, requiring another engineer on your team to pick up the slack or endure stress.


## Alternatives


### Staff Engineer

If the problems above turn you off, consider pursuing the Staff Engineer role. However, it has even fewer open roles than Engineering Manager. The staff+ to engineers proportion is 10-1 rather than 5-1. 

Even as a Staff Engineer, you must still focus on work other than coding. The technical chapters in this book are still worth reading, “Programming Pillar,” since it becomes a shared responsibility between staff and managers. You must also master 1:1s and giving feedback. Consider looking at those chapters as well.


### Product Manager

It is rare, but if you want to be *less *technical, consider moving into product management. The only requirement might be being in a company long enough to be trusted with a lateral move. 

The proportion between openings is the same for both roles because both are needed in a team. However, I used to work on teams where the EM served as the PM because the latter was shared, so the EM must also have product skills. If Product Management interests you, read about the Process, which, despite being EM’s responsibility, is shared with a PM, and the Product pillar, which is the other way around.
