# The art of engineering management

This open-source book is a comprehensive guide for senior engineers and current engineering managers (EM). After 8 years as an EM in multiple companies, I aim to give back by providing practical advice and insights based on real-world experiences and explaining why the manager role is not one but multiple, depending on the company and team configuration.

This book details the engineering manager journey: From transitioning to the role of a senior engineer to empowering others, navigating the gruesome manager interview, speeding the onboarding first days, and finally, creating high-performance teams.

By the end of this book, you will learn about key pillars of people management, product development, process optimization, and technical mentorship.

By making this book open-source, I expect to not only give advice but counterbalance it with advice from readers. Anyone can contribute to and ask questions about it. Feel free to create any issues or ask me questions in our Discord!
