# Your first days as a Manager

To succeed as a manager, you need clarity on your destination and a team that trusts it’s worth pursuing. Your first days are critical for absorbing context and establishing trust — it's an opportunity to leverage first impressions and the most free time you’ll have before taking on more responsibilities.

For your initial weeks, focus on two goals: **understanding context** and **building rapport**.

## Getting Context

#### Your Company and the Industry

Start by grasping how your company operates within its industry and how it stacks up against competitors. The key is identifying how the business *actually* makes money—outsiders often guess incorrectly.

For example, while mobile games might seem to profit from ads or microtransactions, the reality is that a tiny fraction of players (“whales”) drive most revenue. Without attracting and retaining these high spenders, even popular games can fail. When you join the company, your hypothesis that its objective was “making games that attract players” shifts to “making games that attract whales.”

This reflects how large mobile companies are shaped in the industry, while indie studios survives on modest earnings and player satisfaction, larger companies with high payrolls and overhead costs cannot.

Next, determine whether your company is a market leader or challenger. Leaders risk their reputation with severe bugs or outages, while challengers prioritize speed and adaptability over polish. This will shape what approach your team should take on how to ship features.

#### Your Company and Your Squad

Every team exists for a reason. Usually, this boils down to either solving a **critical problem** that requires dedicated focus or pursuing a **strategic bet** to capture market share. Your squad’s mission should directly support this larger goal, and as an Engineering Manager, you need to identify exactly what that is and determine the role your squad should play.

### Learning from documentation

Explore product and technical documentation, but keep in mind that documents are often outdated. Reviewing historical records to understand past decisions and lessons learned is invaluable for avoiding repeated mistakes.

- **Product Docs**: Even with a dedicated Product Manager, you must engage deeply with the product. You’re the bridge between vision and execution. Review documents containing past objectives (OKRs, etc.) and previous strategies for solving your problem domain to set baseline expectations for upcoming quarters.

- **Technical Docs**: Look at the team’s recent tickets to assess how deliverables were handled over the last three months. Finally, check the codebase—but avoid jumping into coding, a common new-manager trap. Even if coding is expected, prioritize getting familiar with broader responsibilities first.

In both cases, document your learnings and update outdated materials. Consider creating an onboarding guide for your successor while you onboard; this highlights gaps in existing documentation that are only visible when experiencing the process firsthand.

### Learning from People

Conversations provide more current and candid insights. While there’s no “wrong” person to talk to initially, prioritize those you’ll interact with most frequently: teammates (engineers, designers, PMs in your squad), your manager, and other Engineering Managers in your group.

#### Meeting with Your Manager

Schedule a meeting with your manager on your first day—don’t wait for them to reach out to you. Discuss role expectations and request the documentation mentioned above. Be transparent about your strengths and areas for growth; their support will shape your success.

Follow up with recurring 1:1s, starting every other day and transitioning to weekly as responsibilities shift. Prioritize asynchronous updates, since you’ll interact far more with your team than with your director.

In these meetings, share key learnings, confirm hypotheses, and discuss your readiness to take ownership of responsibilities.

#### 1:1s with teammates

Gradually schedule 1:1s with colleagues you meet in recurring team meetings. Focus on understanding their roles, motivations, and challenges to show you care.

When schedule meetings, respect “maker's time” — developers resent midday interruptions, while managers are accustomed to meetings. Therefore aim to cluster 1:1 meetings with scheduled team cerimonies to minimize disruptions.

Frame questions around their experience: Are they more a communicator or task-focused? Ask what excites them most about the project, what challenges they’re currently facing, and what they’d change with a “magic wand” (this surfaces common pain points).

Avoid scripting conversations. Listen actively, let discussions flow naturally, and don’t shy away from small talk—it builds rapport.

Approach it like a podcast interview: ask open-ended questions (e.g., “What’s top of mind for you this week?”), practice active listening, and guide them toward their own solutions. For 1:1s with Individual Contributors (ICs), let them drive where the conversation should go.

After initial meetings, set a follow-up cadence (weekly/monthly) based on their proximity to your squad. Adjust based on the value of the conversations.
  
#### Group Meetings

Ask “silly” questions freely—your fresh perspective often reveals overlooked issues.

Observe discussions actively. Share insights from past experiences when relevant, and defer decisions until you’re confident.

If pressed to decide prematurely (e.g., by a PM accustomed to your predecessor’s taking decisions), ask clarifying questions to come up with solutions as team.

During your first few days, make an effort to keep things moving, but avoid rushing into action before you feel confident. Some managers make the mistake of acting too early—and even worse, trying to shape the new company in the image of their previous workplace.

Take the time to learn and adopt the positive aspects of the new culture. Some companies have a more reserved, straight-to-business approach with minimal small talk, while others are more vocal and operate like a passionate, outspoken pirate crew. Embrace what you have.

## Getting out of the onboarding

Onboarding officially ends when your director has transferred every responsibility they managed while covering your role. This will happen gradually, so be proactive in removing the "training wheels" progressively. And once you’re running your squad, you’re not alone—continue to rely on your director and team when needed.

The skills and knowledge you’ve acquired so far will be invaluable in shaping your team’s future. We're just beginning!
