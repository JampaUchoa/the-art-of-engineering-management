# Getting promoted to Engineering Manager

![Crossing the chasm](/assets/chapters/chapter-2-intro.svg)
### Betting on the right horse

Up to the senior engineering level, being promoted depends only on the proficiency bar achieved regarding technical proficiency and communication.

But afterward, whether the option is to go the Staff or Manager route, clearing the bar is not enough—there must be a “business need.” The need for a new engineering manager happens when another manager leaves, or a new squad is formed.

This “business need” means getting promoted to the levels above senior will depend not entirely on the engineer but also on their company. It makes it much more difficult to be promoted in a stalled company since new squads are rarely formed, and when one manager leaves, many people will compete internally for the opening role.

It also means that aggressive companies, like startups with extensive funding, are much more attractive since they constantly need to find new ways to capture their addressable market. This makes hiring happen frequently, and with new squads come new managers.

If you want to move fast in your career, consider joining a startup where you will likely have more opportunities to tackle significant problems and develop your skills faster. It trades stability and salary for a career fast track.

Before accepting an offer, ensure you know the company's expected growth. Useful metrics, such as company headcount growth over time, Glassdoor reviews, funding rounds, and news notoriety, are measurable and public signs of growth that can be searched before joining.

For larger companies, you can also check their customers' experiences on Reddit and other forums, as happy customers generally indicate an upward trend.

### Being the CEO of your career

The good news is that most senior engineers prefer to become staff engineers rather than become managers. At the companies I worked for, it was challenging to hire a manager internally, so we often had to resort to hiring externally. That didn't happen as usual with the staff engineer role.

However, you should not take a passive approach to getting promoted. The maxim in Western culture is, “The squeaky wheel gets the grease.” In some conversations with friends, they expressed deep woes about something, but when asked, “What does your manager say when you discuss that with them?” I was surprised how often they never even mentioned it.

Ideally, your manager should be having discussions about what's next in your career at least every semester. Still, most managers shy away from that, which puts the need on you to bring that conversation since no one has more stake in your career than you.

Be explicit with your career intentions in 1:1s with your current manager. This will help you get feedback tailored to your desired goals and the skills you need to pursue them.

If possible, schedule a skip-level meeting with your director to get advice. This will help you understand the company's challenges at a higher level and build rapport with your potential future manager.

If the manager knows their report also wants to become an EM, valuable knowledge can be shared when relevant. Situations that occur can be used to teach and discuss possible actions and frameworks for future scenarios.

For example, engineers can commit blunders from the perspective of someone who doesn't need managerial skills, like scheduling a meeting to make decisions but not obtaining action points before the end. In this case, their manager is OK with covering for them and ensuring alignment at the meeting's end. However, feedback and possible alternatives will not be given unless the manager knows the IC wants to become a manager.

Focus on aligning with your manager to acquire management skills that can be learned even by a non-manager. These include interviewing candidates, conducting meetings, and interacting with customers.

### Showing signs of leadership

Engineering managers know which ICs they manage and can fill their roles on a day's notice. They are the senior ICs, which others gravitate towards when they need help. They are effective communicators, which also makes them good mentors. They can understand business requirements and analyze technical tradeoffs, making them the "go-to" person when other team members have technical questions.

Another important trait is curiosity, which is essential for giving feedback without being rude. For example, if someone does something weird in the code in a PR, instead of pointing it out and demanding a fix, ask them why they did it that way and not the ideal approach. This shows them you trust their skills and allows them to learn through their thinking.

### Force multiplier

One of the most impactful things you can do is aim to become a force multiplier. This concept is under-noticed among engineers but can make a sizable difference in a project. Force multiplier work is one that, when delivered, will allow other people to deliver faster. Whether you want to be a Staff Engineer or an Engineering Manager, this is the most crucial bar you will need to clear. A staff engineer or an architect does not do 2-10x the work of senior engineers. Still, they make teams 2-10x more productive by working on areas that will have a great impact, like making architecture improvements or removing roadblocks.

For example, a team impacted by constantly shipped bugs leads an engineer to create critical automated testing. This prevents bugs from breaking production and speeds up every engineer on the team by reassuring them that their tickets will not break when shipping, saving hours of debugging.

Another case would be a team that has to work back and forth frequently because new technical requirements constantly change. However, one engineer can produce excellent technical specifications by communicating effectively with stakeholders before writing the first line of code, saving the team hours of rewriting code.

Force multiplier work increases the productivity of everyone involved. If you make a specific improvement that reduces by 5 minutes of your engineer's time in each task, and if they perform about 3 tasks in a working day. In a team with 5 people, you just gave your team **375 days of work in a year**.

Force multipliers are not easy to detect and are very specific to a codebase, making them more challenging to quantify but having a significant impact.  Good potential candidates are bottlenecks and inefficiencies that drive daily aspects of the engineer's work, for example:

* Overengineered code architecture that requires the engineer to write duplicated code across codebases, with some occasional bugs.
* Lack of quality control makes the engineers take more time testing their tickets or shipping bugs requiring new tickets to fix.
* Outdated or reinvent-the-wheel code that introduces a lot of bugs, requires constant attention and makes it hard to find solutions to problems online due to documentation only supporting newer versions.
* There are non-technical cases of being a force multiplier, such as proposing improvements to the shipping process, such as ticket structure and ceremonies, to avoid additional meeting time.

The larger the number of people impacted, the more critical the multiplier aspect is.

Therefore, look for gaps in your team. Your manager can help you identify those, but as someone working actively in the code, you are privileged to know how things are. Asking your fellow engineers what they like/dislike about the project is also a good way to get that information.

Aim to acquire managerial responsibilities over time by having your manager and teammates trust you. The promotion to manager does not occur overnight; it takes months.

Like many others, I worked as a tech lead for a growing startup. My responsibilities gradually changed from architecting the codebase to hiring, mentoring, and talking with clients until I stopped coding as my primary responsibility.

Then, when it was apparent I was managing everything but on paper, I talked with my CTO, who gave me the title the next week and charged me with hiring a second team for a new company initiative.

In the end, if a promotion does not happen, you can highlight your managerial achievements during interviews with other companies. This leads to our next chapter…
