# Navigating the Engineering Manager interview

At first glance, manager interviews may not seem much different from individual contributor interviews—you’ll still be doing coding, architecture, and culture rounds. 

The key difference lies in how you’re evaluated: Communication skills carry much more weight than coding ability. Failing to communicate effectively means you won’t get an offer even if you excel technically.


## Being an effective communicator

How you communicate is as important as what you communicate. During an interview, your responses should be brief, concise, and interesting.


### Being brief — The Interview Anti-Pattern

Manager interviews can sometimes feel like an anti-pattern because interviewers aren’t looking for deep technical knowledge. The more I knew about management, the more I struggled with interviews—until I realized that, at least in the initial rounds, interviewers expected to fill specific skill checkboxes. 

I was sabotaging myself by providing overly detailed answers: I would share every relevant situation I could think of in response to a broad question. And, the more I knew, the longer my responses became.

Interviewers want to see you grasp the overall concepts before testing you for deeper knowledge. So, keep your answers brief— and let them come with follow-up questions if they want more details.


### Getting to the point

When answering interview questions, aim to be. One popular strategy is the STAR method: 

• Situation: Briefly describe the context and background of the challenge or opportunity, explaining where you were and why the situation mattered.

• Task: Clearly define what needs to be accomplished by outlining your responsibilities or objectives in that scenario.

• Action: Detail the specific steps you took to address the task, emphasizing your role, the strategies you implemented, and how you overcame obstacles.

• Result: Summarize the outcomes by highlighting the positive impact, measurable improvements, or lessons learned from your actions.

The STAR method is common in interview advice and is covered in detail by many books and articles, but while it’s an essential foundation, it isn't sufficient on its own.


### Being interesting

If you listen to podcasts, you’ll notice that experienced speakers structure their stories with clear beats—using transitions like “and therefore” or “but…”—so that each action naturally leads to a consequence. They often add reactions, whether their own or those of others involved, to enhance the story. This is key to being a good storyteller.

Avoid overusing phrases like “and then,” as they don’t add significant value to your narrative. Your story should have a clear direction and reach its point gradually. Also, steer clear of unnecessary parenthesis — save any extra fun facts for when you join their company.


## Types of Interview


### Managing Experience

The most common interview questions you’ll face focus on past situations. If you haven’t held a formal management role before, this can be challenging since you might not have concrete examples—especially when asked questions like, “When was the last time you conducted performance reviews?”. 

Ironically, if you have a lot of management experience, you might struggle too because you have so many examples that it’s hard to pick the most relevant one. A good strategy is to pick the relevant example that is most recent so you can recall the details better.

If you’ve never been a manager and are asked about a situation you’ve never encountered, be honest and then, you can follow up with a hypothetical response.

For example one of the most common interview questions: 

> “Tell me the last time you had to handle underperforming engineer”

A good response could be:

> I never had one, I am thankful for all my engineers being stellar, but the way I approach underperformance is …

This shows that, even without direct experience, you understand the concepts and strategies involved to deal with a situation if that arises.

Another common interview question type involves hypothetical scenarios. The best approach is to begin by asking a few clarifying questions. Answering with “It depends” might sound like a cliché response, but it is still the best starter since there is no one-size-fits-all for building software.

No matter what, always keep your responses positive. People appreciate managers who look for the upside in difficult situations. Avoid being rude or grumpy, and steer clear of putting anyone down—especially your colleagues. Instead, try to highlight the bright side even in challenging scenarios or the lessons learned.


### Coding / Architecture

You need to brush up on your architecture skills—even if you haven't coded in a long time. Some companies might not require their managers to code at all, yet they still expect them to be strong architects. They are not wrong: A coach does not enter the field, but they still must know how to play.

Remember: You'll be evaluated more on your communication skills than your technical expertise. 

If you're given a problem like "create a URL shortener for a million users," your chances of success increases the clearer you explain your approach. They aren’t expecting you to reinvent TinyURL, but to know how well you communicate your thoughts.

When faced with a problem, start by breaking it down and asking clarifying questions. For example, ask how many users the URL shortener is expected to have or what the ratio is between users accessing URLs versus those creating them. 

It's okay to make assumptions, but you should always communicate them—such as: “I am assuming that some URLs might be significantly more popular than others”.

Depending on the interview, you might be required to use a specific tool or choose one. Even if no tool is mandated, it’s a good idea to use one, and get practice beforehand with a whiteboard app (like Excalibur).

Share your screen so the interviewer can see what you're working on and interact with you directly. It is better than sending a "Share” link.

I believe my curiosity once saved me from failing an architecture interview. After finishing the architecture interview, I asked the interviewer how the interviewer would approach the problem. 

I learned that the company scaled its architecture using Kafka, and we ended up having a conversation about team size, costs, and maintainability. We even discussed different tech stacks, which made the interviewer happy, and I received an offer from that company.


### Cultural questions

This is often the easiest one: The main objective is to see how well you align with the company values. This is generally the easiest interview.

The best thing you can do to prepare is to read the company values on their company website. Read and understand those to heart because you will be asked how you applied those values in the past, and that is the core part of the cultural interview. 


### Becoming the interviewer

The cultural interview is generally with an executive. This can be the opportunity to see how people at the top of the company think, therefore this interview is very useful for you to know about where the company is heading. 

To come up with good questions, research the company as much as you can, this will be good to clear reluctance about joining.

One red flag about companies is when they are not able to answer clearly what their vision and goals are. The vision is what they want to be in the long term, like "being the company for X", and the goal should be something to do in the short term, like "Releasing the new tool that will drive us in a new segment" and not “get more users”. If the short-term goal is not clear the company might be heading nowhere. 

Easy interview right? Yes, but sometimes there is a catch:


#### The catch

Sometimes the cultural interviewer wants to go in another completely different direction by replaying a previous interview, like architecture, so be ready for it. The other curveball is them going detective mode on your resume.

If the interviewer pulls the detective mode, they will try to ask questions about your resume during the interview, and try to poke for gaps or argue on things that you previously did. 

The best you can do is to give precise but short information so you avoid them trying to pull a loose thread. Don't overextend here, avoid being overconfident.

They will likely ask why you want to leave your company and even each previous company than that as well. Don't throw anyone, including the last company, under the bus here or you will get disqualified.

Depending on how pushy they are, you should decide if you still want to be in the company after this interview. I had some interviewers enjoying the "detective" mode too much and going straight up "asshole" mode. 

If they neg you, belittle previous accomplishments, or downplay your accomplishments, this tells all you need to know about the company, keep in mind the culture interview is made by people who are influencing culture the most, if you encounter that type of interviewer, here is my advice: **run**.

They know that you have little leverage as a candidate, and their attitude to justify negging as being as tough interviewer is just a façade.


## How to know when you aced the interview

At the interview's end, the interviewer will give you signals about whether they want to hire you or not — if they start selling the company to you, or want to keep talking with you, shows clear excitement that you are the candidate that will save them from interviewing. If they say things like "When you join here, or you will," then the interview is in the bag!

If they are cold or replying very briefly to your questions at the end, it might mean that is it. There is nothing you can do to change your interviewer's mind. But you can ask questions that will be valuable feedback for future interviews like "If I would join this position, based on our conversation, what advice would you give me on the first day". 

There are some interviewers who will keep their cards close to the chest, but by this time, you have not much to lose. Getting feedback on failed interviews is invaluable for the future.

If your first interview was with someone non-technical like a recruiter or HR, always follow up by asking for feedback by email after the interview. Recruiters are great at providing "championship" for the candidates, some even gave me the raw interviewer notes!


## Bonus: Negotiating an offer

Once you receive an offer letter you are the one with the leverage: future teammates are excited about you joining and eager for you to start. And most importantly for the interview process to be over, after getting an offer you need to decide if the salary matches your expectations and negotiate a beginning date. 

If you want to know how much your compensation should be, research Glassdoor / Levels, this will pay off in additional thousands of dollars earned per month. You can see what type of salary the company is providing, but other companies in similar markets and locations are also paying.

From experience comparing compensation aggregators with real data, I observed that aggregators' websites exaggerated the salary range by 10% - 20% from the real median. This could be that people more successful in negotiating use more of these sites and therefore report higher salaries. There are also unrealistic salaries posted that differ greatly from others, so keep that in mind.

If you feel that you are in a position to negotiate a higher salary, show eagerness to do it and work with them to get your salary up. No one will rescind an offer when you ask for more. But they can revoke the offer depending on how you do it — As long as you are not arrogant, you won't lose anything by asking more. I’ve seen candidates have the offer to be rescinded after showing arrogance.

Sometimes the company cannot offer more, the offer is their entire budget. Even after rejecting the offer due to compensation, you can keep a door open and even receive an offer sometimes with a higher position after a few months.

You will also negotiate the start date, you will be pressured to start right after the 2 weeks' notice. But feel free to push back and have time off to decompress from the old job. I always gave myself 2 weeks after leaving the old job to decompress and I really can't recommend it enough, it will also be better for the company to get the most relaxed version of yourself.
