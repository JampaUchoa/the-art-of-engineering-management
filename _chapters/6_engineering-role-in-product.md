# The Engineering Role in Shaping the Product

Product is the most critical pillar of a squad. It doesn't matter if your tech stack is state-of-the-art and bug-free if the value it delivers has no impact. Most startups fail because they run out of cash before shipping products that people want.

Even if you're not in a startup, every team essentially operates like a small company within the larger organization. If no one is interested in what your squad is doing and it has no impact, it's only a matter of time before the team is disbanded or faces layoffs. Therefore, solidifying your squad's reason for being is critical before the company tightens its budget.

The first step to shipping the right things is knowing your problem domain. This boils down to, “What problem was my squad created to solve? For whom?” This helps you understand your target market and their problems. You need to know your customers well, their current issues, how they work around them, and what value will be delivered when they use your product.

In most companies, a squad will also include a Product Manager (PM) who typically owns this pillar, but Product is ultimately a shared team responsibility. **It's too important to leave up to one person.**


## Product Manager vs. Engineering Manager

Your product manager (PM) champions the "what" and "why" of a product. They conduct market research and user analysis to understand your target customers—who they are and the problems they need solved.

Using this research, PMs map potential solutions and features. They then prioritize these solutions based on the value they could bring, such as potential revenue, increased user conversion, or better engagement.

Having a product manager on your team is a valuable asset. While engineers complain about the extra meetings PMs can introduce, they are critical for defining the right features to build, ensuring engineering efforts are well-directed. They help answer the crucial question: “Are we building the right thing?”


### Collaborating with your PM


If you have a PM, they will share this pillar (and part of the Process). You need to work closely with them to establish a healthy product roadmap and receive context on the expectations around your squad. 

It's your responsibility to align on potential technical blockers that could impact the final product or its delivery date. You will keep each other accountable for those responsibilities.

Your PM will be talking with all sorts of people—executives, clients, other PMs, and leads. These chats often spark requests that need your technical perspective. Sometimes, these requests are pretty straightforward, and your role will be to help figure out the best timing for them on the roadmap. 

Other times, a new idea might not be quite doable with your current tech. You will need to push back, align, and adjust the scope to seek a better impact-to-effort ratio.

Once your team assembles a part of the roadmap, you'll delegate the solution's architecture to your engineers. You'll then work with them to establish milestones and deadlines, communicating these back to the PM.

This close collaboration also helps your PM build trust in your team, which is critical when you provide effort estimates for proposed solutions. They must believe in your team's capability to deliver, as they'll often defend your timelines and plans to upper management.


### When you don't have a PM

** If you don't have a PM, you'll be required to act as one, even if it's only part of their responsibilities.** In companies where the PM leaves or becomes overwhelmed, the team might see its product roadmap stall, run out of projects, or begin prioritizing the wrong initiatives. Someone must own the Product pillar.

Not having a dedicated PM permanently can be valid in certain scenarios. For example, the CEO often takes on this role in early-stage startups, building client relationships and bringing market insights directly to the engineering team.

Another scenario is a purely technical project, like a large-scale database migration. Here, the target value and success metrics are often so clear to EMs and engineers that a dedicated PM might not be necessary, as the technical team inherently understands the "what" and "why."

## Why Your Engineers Need to Care

Managers are responsible for the product, but it's essential for everyone in the squad to care about it, even if you have a highly competent Product Manager. Getting your engineers to care about the product is one of your core responsibilities as an engineering manager.
You need to be an evangelist for the problems your team is there to solve. Help your engineers develop empathy for the challenges your clients face and see the positive impact their work will have on clients' lives once the project is delivered.

The first reason you do this is to **motivate people**. A few times as an engineer, I wondered, “Who is this feature even for? Who will use it?”. No one on my team knew. We were just doing it because we were told to. Our morale was low, and we felt we were working on things that didn't matter.

The second reason is that **your team isn't paid to create code but to solve problems**. Code has value only when it affects the end-user. You can have the best Kubernetes cluster, with a great dashboard and zero bugs, but if it only supports, say, triple-digit usage, none of that technical excellence will truly matter. Your engineers need to understand the value delivered to be more efficient when assessing tradeoffs in a solution.

The last reason is that a team must be **passionate about problems, not solutions**. Initial ideas rarely happen as planned, and the same goes for codebases and architecture. You want your engineers to be able to pivot quickly away from a solution that might be a dead end and focus on solving the problem in other ways if necessary.

### **The cost of not caring**

One way companies try to work around engineers not caring deeply about the product is by creating tickets with very strict templates and detailed “definitions of done.” The goal is to reduce the risk of engineers building the wrong thing. But this approach doesn't solve the fundamental problem of helping engineers see the bigger picture, especially when context is only provided at the ticket level.

This approach also tends to overload PMs with ticket writing, rather than freeing them up to involve the team in product discovery. Broader team involvement could spark new ideas and provide valuable feedback for shaping the product, maximizing value and minimizing effort. You can still use “definitions of done,” but it’s often better if these are drafted by the engineers and validated by the PM.

We call the role “software engineer” and not “software coder” because engineering requires a deep understanding of problems to build solutions. 

With the rise of LLMs, software engineering is becoming even more like traditional engineering disciplines. For instance, electrical engineers design circuits but don't necessarily lay all the wires themselves; civil engineers design buildings, but don't personally construct them. The engineering core is problem-solving and design, not just the act of building.

If they don't understand the value, they will build blindly, leading to rework later. If an engineer runs into a blocker, they won't be able to properly analyze whether the effort is truly justified. Instead, they might spend much time tackling low-value tasks or 'nice-to-have' features that don't align with core priorities because they are building without context.
