## What role will you perform

The engineering manager role varies widely across companies—sometimes within the same organization. Your priorities will not be defined by your director but by your team’s unique challenges and dynamics.

You will be there but guarantee that the team delivers and is healthy to keep delivering, the things that will require your attention are mostly reinforcing the weakest aspects your the team at the given time, dealing with bottlenecks and recurring roadblocks, and ensuring they are handled before it becomes a bigger problem

### Escalate, intervene or hire

To address these challenges effectively, you can escalate issues by managing up, tackle problems directly yourself, or seek support via hiring or transfers. The right approach depends on your ability to maintain sufficient bandwidth across priorities to manage multiple responsibilities simultaneously.

As a manager, you can't afford to focus on a single task for too long without risking bottlenecks in the shipping process. Constant context-switching is inevitable—your reports, leadership, and clients will all demand attention across different domains. Therefore dedicating too much time to one responsibility often means neglecting others.

The key is strategically prioritizing your time where it leads to maximum impact and for your unique ability to execute. Delegate tasks whenever possible (e.g., assign engineers to specific workstreams), but be prepared to personally handle critical tasks your when deadlines are near and team capacity is full. If crunch-time and your intervention is a recurring theme, it signals the need to expand your team through hiring.


## Knowing what to do

As a manager, your focus centers on four key pillars: Product, Process, People, and Programming. Each will be explored in depth throughout this book. These areas are shaped by physical factors (visible, tangible elements like team structure) and logical factors (context-driven dynamics). 


### Physical factors

Physical factors stem from your team’s composition, including their seniority, roles, and organizational expectations.


#### Programming

If you have more than four engineers in your team you should code very little or sometimes avoid altogether. With a smaller team of experienced engineers, you may occasionally contribute code, provided the other pillars are balanced.

Resist the urge to tackle critical programming tasks that others will depend upon. to avoid becoming a bottleneck, since managerial priorities will inevitably arise, pulling you away from working on the codebase. Instead, focus on improvements on the infrastructure and codebase that allows the other engineers to move faster.

#### People

Team size and organizational scale directly impact in your attention in this pillar. With more people, more work is needed to ensure a healthy career development for each engineer. In larger organizations, it is also needed to ensure their contributions are recognized and aligned with the company's demands.

#### Product

You should never shy away from caring about a product. If what you are building is something don't believe in, it means your team's job might not exist in a few months, your product success is key for your team to evolve in the company, including you.

You should sometimes push back on feature requests, even from PMs and sometimes your CEO, the value of an ask is disproportionately low compared to the effort of implementing, sometimes someone asking has no idea how hard or how easy to implement something.

If there is no dedicated Product Manager you will need to fill in the shoes of a part-time PM and make decisions on their behalf, for example, if your team needs new features to work or risk becoming idle it becomes your responsibility to get in touch with stakeholders or manage up to get more work. 

#### Process

If your project has contractual deadlines, your process will need to be very oriented to reduce risks as much as possible, this requires giving extra attention to it. Since the team will need to balance scope / team capacity with deadlines. You will need to assemble a visible timeline and be accountable for it. This is something that the PM might help, but engineering needs to own it. On the other hand, a company with few engineering teams might get away with only a whiteboard and a checklist.

## Logical

Logical factors are elements deeply rooted in a team’s technical dynamics. Unlike physical factors, these are not immediately visible but persistently impact the team’s efficiency and morale. This is why technical expertise remains critical for engineering managers—they must identify and address challenges that aren’t obvious to non-technical stakeholders.

While there’s no definitive checklist for these qualitative factors, a practical approach is to examine your software development lifecycle (SDLC). Think of the SDLC as a pipeline: it begins with deciding what to build and ends with delivering value to users. Bottlenecks and roadblocks can be at any stage, so focus on identifying where friction occurs.

### Questions for indentifying logical factors

#### How do we decide what to build?

While primarily a responsibility of doing market and user research (Product), sometimes there is a hesitation caused by gaps in expertise (Programming) or resource constraints (People).

#### Who decides what to build?

This may require aligning with leadership (People) or integrating user feedback loops (Product) into the workflow (Process).

#### Do we over-plan instead of executing?

A Process issue, though sometimes caused by rigid top-down mandates (People) that need managing up.

#### Is everyone productive?

Individual recurring issues would fall under giving feedback and mentorship (People), while others should be dealt with by resolving systemic inefficiencies (Process).

#### What delays shipping new work?

Look for recurring technical debt (Programming) or excessive bureaucracy (Process).

#### Do we build robust solutions or constantly revisit work?

Premature releases without getting traction due to a (Product) market misalignment, whereas technical problems might require the team to make it more scalable and robust (Programming).

#### Are we aligned on technical trade-offs?

For example, prioritizing speed over scalability (Programming) or sacrificing polish for deadlines (Product).

#### Are we proactively managing technical debt?

Ignoring debt (Programming) or failing to prioritize it (Process) can create compounding bottlenecks.
